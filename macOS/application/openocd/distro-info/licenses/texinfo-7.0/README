Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source to produce
many forms of output:
- a PDF or DVI document (via the TeX typesetting system) with the normal
  features of a book, including sectioning, cross references, indices, etc.
- an Info file with analogous features
- a plain text (ASCII) file
- HTML output suitable for use with a web browser
- an EPUB 3 e-book
- a LaTeX file, which can then be used to create a PDF
- a Docbook file

See ./INSTALL* for installation instructions.

To get started with Texinfo, you can read the Texinfo manual
online at https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo.

If you don't have Internet access, you can read the manual locally:
- first, build the distribution.
- then, for HTML, run: make -C doc html
  and you can start reading at doc/texinfo_html/index.html.
- for PDF, if you have a working TeX, run: make -C doc pdf
- for Info, you can read the manual:
 ./info/ginfo doc/info-stnd
  and/or read the Texinfo manual:
 ./info/ginfo doc/texinfo

Texinfo mailing lists and archives:
- https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-texinfo
  for bug reports, enhancement suggestions, technical discussion.
- https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-texinfo
  for authoring questions and general discussion.

Bug reports:
Please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of all input files needed to reproduce the bug (crucial!).
- a statement of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of Texinfo and the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware and operating system information (uname -a).
- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (try ./config.status --help).
- anything else that you think could be helpful.

Patches are welcome; if possible, please make them with diff -c or
git diff and include ChangeLog entries.

See README-hacking for information on the Texinfo development
environment -- any interested parties are welcome.  If you're a
programmer and wish to contribute, this should get you started.

Texinfo documentation files
    doc/texinfo.texi       Describes the Texinfo language and many
                           of the associated tools.  It tells how to use
                           Texinfo to write documentation, how to use
                           Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs, TeX, texi2any, and
                           much else.

    doc/info-stnd.texi     How to use the standalone GNU Info reader that is
                           included in this distribution (./info).

Printing-related files:
    doc/texinfo.tex        This implements Texinfo in TeX, to typeset a
                           Texinfo file into a DVI or PDF file.

    util/texi2dvi          This is a shell script for producing an
                           indexed DVI file using TeX and texindex.
    
    util/texi2pdf          Generate PDF (wrapper for texi2dvi).

Source directories: 
  djgpp/                   Support for compiling under DJGPP.
  gnulib/                  Support files from Gnulib.
  info/                    Standalone Info reader.
  install-info/            Maintain the Info dir file.
  tp/                      Texinfo Parser in Perl, includes texi2any.
  texindex/                The `texindex' program that generates
                           sorted indices used by TeX when
                           typesetting a file for printing.

Translation support:
  po/                      Strings of the programs.
  po_document/             Strings in generated Texinfo documents.

Installation support:
  Makefile.am              Read by Automake to create a Makefile.in.
  Makefile.in              Read by configure to make a Makefile,
                             created by Automake.
  configure.ac             Read by Autoconf to create `configure'.
  configure                Configuration script for local conditions,
                             created by Autoconf.
  build-aux/               Common files.

The util/ directory contains a few other scripts, e.g., examples of
using texi2any in various ways.  See util/README.

Some files in this package have their copyright years stated as a range
('2008-2010') rather than listed as individual years ('2008, 2009, 
2010').
